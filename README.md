# JavaScript Basics: A Beginner's Guide

Welcome to the **JavaScript Basics: A Beginner's Guide**! I designed this project to help beginners get 
started with JavaScript, one of the most popular programming languages used in web development.

This guide is based on my own learning experience, using methods that made JS simple and easy for me to understand.

## Getting Started

To follow along with this guide, all you need is a text editor (like Visual Studio Code) and a web browser (like Chrome or Firefox). No prior programming experience is required!

### Installing a Text Editor

If you don’t have a text editor yet, i recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It’s free, powerful, and widely used by developers.

### Setting Up Your First JavaScript File

1. Open your text editor.
2. Create a new file and name it `index.html`.
3. After creating your .html file, create a new file then name it `index.js`
4. Inside `index.html`, set up a basic HTML structure using this command "!" and link your JavaScript file using the <script></script> tag inside the body.
